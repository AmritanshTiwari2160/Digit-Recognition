# DIGIT-RECOGNITION
Digit Recognition with MNIST Dataset Using Neural Networks
This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark for this type of task, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
